	<h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>
		<p>This is a really simpke dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at parties. My father recommends:</p>
		<blockquote><p> "Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter, try serving it warm."</p></blockquote>
		<h2>Ingrediants</h2>
	
		<ul>
		<li>8oz. jar subdried tomatoes</li>
		<li>large garlic cloves</li>
		<li>2/3 c. kalmata olives</li>

		</ul>
	<h2>Instructions</h2>
