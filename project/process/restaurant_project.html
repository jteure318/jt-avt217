	<h1>Restaurant Critique Project</h1>
	<p> Throughuot my search, I looked at restaurants sites and picked 5 that were close to where
	I live.</p>

<h2>Yard House<br><br>
	<a href="http://yardhouse.com/"><img src="img/yardhouse.png" style="width:45em; height: 30em;"  alt="Yardhouse website"></a></h2>
	<p>The design of the website is very clean compisition. They make it easy for customers to access restaurants near them, and see what the latest deals and speacials including food and drinks during the week. Whats also nice due to Covid-19 concerns, they also put notices on steps they are taking to prevent the spread.</p>
